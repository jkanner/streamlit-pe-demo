# streamlit-pe-demo

Demo Streamlit app to work with PE samples from GWTC-2 catalog

Because the sample files are huge and contain many waveforms, will make a
limited set of samples that only includes a small number of waveforms.

`make-samples.py` Script to create archive of smaller PE sample files.
